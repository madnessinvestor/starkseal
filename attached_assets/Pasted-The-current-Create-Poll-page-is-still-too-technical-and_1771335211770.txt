The current "Create Poll" page is still too technical and does not clearly explain to users what they are creating.

Goal:
Redesign the wording and flow of the page so that a non-technical user immediately understands:
- What they are creating
- What people will vote on
- What happens when someone votes
- When results will be shown

This must feel like a normal voting form, not a blockchain configuration screen.

Required changes:

1) Page purpose (very important)
- At the top of the page, clearly state in simple language:
  “You are creating a private vote.”
  “People will vote anonymously.”
  “Only the final result will be shown.”

2) Replace technical explanations
- Remove or rewrite any mention of:
  commit-reveal
  cryptography
  protocol
- Use simple language instead:
  “Votes are secret.”
  “No one can see individual votes.”
  “The system only shows the final result.”

3) Clarify what each field means

- POLL_TITLE:
  Rename to: “Voting Question”
  Helper text: “This is the question people will vote on.”

- DESCRIPTION:
  Helper text: “Optional context to help voters understand the question.”

- CREATOR_ADDRESS:
  Do NOT show this field to users.
  This is an internal blockchain detail and should be hidden.

- VOTING_DEADLINE:
  Rename to: “Voting ends on”
  Helper text: “People can vote until this date.”

- REVEAL_DEADLINE:
  Rename to: “Results available on”
  Helper text: “The final result will be shown on this date.”

4) Button clarity
- Change the main button text to something explicit, for example:
  “Create Private Vote”
- Add a short note below the button:
  “You can share this vote with others once it is created.”

5) Overall tone
- Use friendly, human language.
- Avoid developer or blockchain terms.
- Assume the user has never used a crypto app before.

Constraints:
- Do NOT change smart contracts.
- Do NOT add new features.
- Do NOT redesign the entire UI layout.
- Only improve wording, labels, helper text, and clarity.

End result:
A normal user should understand in under 5 seconds that they are creating
a private, anonymous vote and what will happen next.
