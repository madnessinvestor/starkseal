You are continuing an existing Starknet hackathon project.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
The current repository already has:
- Starknet Sepolia testnet setup
- Wallet connection (Argent X / Braavos)
- Commit–reveal style logic
- Basic UI and scripts

The goal is to ADAPT the project into a PRIVATE VOTING application,
NOT to start from scratch and NOT to overengineer.

New project objective:
Transform this project into a privacy-preserving voting system on Starknet,
where individual votes are confidential and only the final result is revealed.

Core concept (must be followed):
- Each voter submits a vote as a hashed commitment
- Votes are NOT stored in plaintext on-chain
- During the reveal phase, voters reveal their vote
- The contract tallies the final result
- Individual votes are never visible before reveal

What to do (step by step):
1) Rename the project conceptually from auction to private voting
   - Update variable names, function names, and comments accordingly
   - Example: bid -> vote, auction -> poll

2) Update the Cairo smart contract:
   - createPoll
   - commitVote(hash)
   - revealVote(choice, nonce)
   - tallyResults
   Do NOT add ZK circuits or heavy cryptography.
   Use commit–reveal as simplified confidential-style logic.

3) Keep Starknet Sepolia testnet as the deployment target.

4) Keep wallet interaction exactly as is:
   - Users must sign transactions with a Starknet wallet
   - msg.sender must be used to identify voters

5) Update or add minimal starknet.js scripts so a user can:
   - connect wallet
   - commit a vote
   - reveal a vote
   - view final results

6) Update the UI only where necessary:
   - Change labels and messages to voting terminology
   - Do NOT redesign the UI

7) Rewrite the README.md so a juror understands the project in under 1 minute.
   The README must clearly explain:
   - What the project does (private voting)
   - Why vote privacy matters
   - How commit–reveal provides confidentiality
   - How to deploy and run on Starknet Sepolia
   - How to demo the voting flow

Constraints:
- Hackathon MVP only
- No new features beyond private voting
- No overengineering
- Focus on clarity, usability, and correctness

Start by reviewing the existing repository, listing the minimal changes needed,
and then implement them.
